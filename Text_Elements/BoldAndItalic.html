    <h1> "Strong" and "Em" elements (negrito e itálico).</h1>
    <text> <strong> This example shall be written in English just for the sake of language practice. </strong></text>
    <p> At this point we have already tryied using some basic raw-text containers, like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;text&gt; -
      which I tried and differenciated'em in the commented boilerplate example. Thus they are going to be assumed as
      trivial.
      <br> It is also worth noting that, though it isn't recommended, text may be printing directly below the body
      element with no text container at all.
    </p>
    <br> <!-- Line Break (Emmet Abbreviation)-->

    <h2> "Strong" Element (bold imporant texts) </h2>
    <p> The strong element, &lt;strong&gt; ... &lt;/strong&gt;, makes the text in between the strong tags
      <strong>bold</strong>. This also confers importance to the text, which maybe used to modolute the tone of voice by
      screen readers which aid people with visual impairments or disabilities. It's also possible to make some text bold
      without making them more imporant through CSS - but I just didn't started CSS in Odin Project curriculum yet.
      <br> Strong element may even be used on its own (without a text container as paragraph). But it's a practice to be
      avoid and also requires unnecessary efforts to break lines, format and adapt to screens.
      <br> The line below is an example of use of &lt;strong&gt; tags without a text container.
    </p>

    <!-- "&emsp;" Inclui um tabulação (grande, 4 espaços)  que pode ser entendida como quatro vezes o tamanho do espaço normal-->
    &emsp;
    <!-- Some other tabulations: &nbsp; ("not-breakable space" of 2 char length) and &ensp; (a breakable tab space of 2 char length) -->
    "Este é um texto avulso e <strong> usa negreito (strong tag)</strong>."
    <br>

    <text> As you can check in this page's source code, an extra break line <strong> ( &lt;br&gt; )</strong> and a
      tabulation space <strong>( &amp;emsp; )</strong> was needed in order to keep the line above separate from the
      previous and current paragraph and format it. </text>

    <h2> "Em" Element ( <em>italic emphasized</em> texts)</h2>
    <text> Similarly we can use &lt;em&gt; ... &lt;/em&gt;, to emphasize some parts of our texts by making it "italic".
      Just like the &lt;strong&gt; tag, an &lt;/m&gt; tag may impact users who are using any type of screen-readers or
      reading aid. That's because, since italic texts are used to emphasize some information or text fragments in
      printed texts, these tags may be used to modulate voice or something in order to sonically emphasize the text in
      between &lt;/em&gt; tags.
      <br> &lt;/em&gt; tags may also be used alienated from the classics containers - just like &lt;strong&gt; tags:
    </text>

    <br>
    &emsp;
    <em>Este é um texto enfatizado com itálico avulso de containers!</em>
    <br>

    <h2> HTML Identation and Nesting</h2>
      <p> This Odin Project's lesson also covers Nesting and Indentations importance in a html source-code (the parent/child relationship stablished between elements in further degrees of indentation). However this kind of indentation care and nesting relationship are kind of given to most people even with little knowledge or experience with some of actual the programming languages. 
      <br> It does worth noting that <strong> indentation, parent-relation and nesting are quite important concepts </strong> and are not be taken lightly or friviously. These concepts may also be way more imporant in HTML and CSS than in actual procedural or functional paradigms programing languages - although I ain't got sufficient knowledge or time to explore it further and precisely yet. </p>
      <p> <strong> That's perfectly why we are keeping every little code neatly indented and organized! </strong> </p>
  
    <h2> &lt;!-- This is an commented text text! --&gt; </h2>
    <text> Learning how to use commented text in web-pages source-code has been a greater priority since the first boilerplate (which was fully commented). Therefore, it's also not being covered in this example once again.
    <br> Even so, the header above is actualy really self-explanatory, though. </text>
