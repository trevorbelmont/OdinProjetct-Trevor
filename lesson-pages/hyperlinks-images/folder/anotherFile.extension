This file is located in another forder. A folder near the previous page location, but a little deeper into the directory's folders.
the "./folder/file.extension" syntax points the hyperlink toward a file inside subfolder of the initial page current directory.
This file has another name and also uses a ridiculously idiot and silly extension.
