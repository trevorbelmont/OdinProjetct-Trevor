        <font size="+3"> This lesson-page exercise handles how to use <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> to turn any
          element or fragment of
          element
          (e.g. parts of a texts) into an anchor to another content (page, site, video, img or whatsoever). We are also
          going to learn how to use the <strong> "href"</strong> attribute to point and direct these anchors to specific
          locations (url).
          <br>We are also going to learn how to display images in our sites, be it from our own domain or from
          another's.
          Simply combining those techniques we must be able to turn an image an hyperlink too.

    <h2 class="sectionHeader"> Anchors and Hyper-References : &lt;a href="address"&gt;</h2>
    <p> The <b>&lt;a&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</b>, "anchor" elements tags, turns almost every content element between these
      tags into an anchor to <a href="https://google.com">another page or content</a>. However, just delimiting an
      anchor with some anchor tags are not enough to point that anchor to any other page or content. Thus, creating only
      <a href=""> an empty anchor</a> will lead us to nowhere else through a pointless hyperlink.
      <br> The <strong> target="_blank" </strong> attribute setting in the "anchor" tag defines whether the link shall
      be open in a new blank tab.
    </p>
    <h2> The "href" attribute </h2>
    <p> In order to point an anchor content, <b>&lt;a&gt;, to its actual destination we add the <strong>
          "href"</strong> attribute to the anchor element opening tag</b>. This way - be it an image, a text, a button
      or anything - the anchored element will become a <a href="https://willyoupressthebutton.com/"> clickable visual
        shortcut </a> to the referenced content address. </p>
    <h2> Absolute and Relative <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images#absolute-and-relative-links">Links</a>
      in "href"</h2>
    <p> Depending on whether we're pointing to an address inside or outside our page domain, we will have to use two
      different types of hyper-referencing - absolute and relative.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images#absolute-and-relative-links:~:text=our%20own%20websites-,Absolute%20Links,-Links%20to%20pages">
          <strong>Absolute Links</strong>
        </a>
        <text> <br> &emsp;Those are the ones we use to link our content element to a page or address from another domain
          other than the linking page current domain. Absolute links are supposed to always follow the
          <b>"protocol://domain/path"</b> pattern. Preferably we must chose "https" protocol over "http" when both are
          available. "Domain" is literally self-explanatory and "path" is the rest of the address which leads us to the
          exactly page or content in the given domain that our anchor element is anchored to. E.g.: &emsp;
          <a
            href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/absolute-link#:~:text=An%20absolute%20link%20is%20a,FTP%20(File%20Transfer%20Protocol).">
            "https:// + techtarget.com/ + ridiculous-long-path" </a> </text>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images#absolute-and-relative-links:~:text=theodinproject.com/about-,Relative%20Links,-Links%20to%20other">
          <strong>Relative Links</strong>
        </a>
        <text> <br> &emsp;On the other hand, whenever we want to link our elements to another page within our own domain
          we simply use relative links. Relative links are relative to our domain index and are pointed quite similarly
          to how we point folders on terminal and powershell: mostly using directories names, bars and typing file
          extensions. <b>"protocol://domain/path"</b> pattern. Preferably we must chose "https" protocol over "http"
          when both are available. "Domain" is literally self-explanatory and "path" is the rest of the address which
          leads us to the exactly page or content in the given domain that our anchor element is anchored to. E.g.:
          &emsp;

            href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-link-pages-using-relative-URL-in-HTML#:~:text=The%20values%20of%20these%20attributes,to%20use%20the%20current%20folder.">
            "https:// + tutorialspoint.com/ + awful-path" </a> </text>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> &emsp; 4 Ways of Indicating Relative Paths </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="file.extension">"file.extension"</a> : Used when linking to content in the same folder.</li>
      <li>

        <ul>
          <li> <a href="folder/anotherFile.extension">"folder/anotherFile.extension"</a> : Links to the given file
            content in the given folder path from the current directory forward.</li>
          <li> <a href="./folder/anotherFile.extension">" ./folder/anotherFile.extension"</a> : Does exactly
            the same as above but with less risks of crashing.</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li> <a href="/lesson-pages/boilerplates-html/Index.html"> (root)/folder/someFile.extension"</a> : Points content
        relative to the index location. The "/" at the beginning signifies the domain's root folder. </li>
      <li> <a href="../text_elements/Negritos-Italicos.html"> (parent)../otherFolder/anyFile.extension</a> : Use "../"
        to ascend to the parent folder and navigate the folder from there on. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="sectionHeader"> Images, Source and Alt. Descriptions: &lt;img src="adress" alt="description"&gt; </h1>
    <p> In order to make our site more attractive or achieve specific goals we may probably want to add <a
        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images#images"> pictures</a> to our
      pages.Thus we shall use the self-closing <strong> &lt;img&gt;</strong> element. While HTML has a great variety of
      elements to handle different types of media contents, the "img" is surely one of the most used. A "img" element
      must perform 3 types of actions: be the container to the picture media, point the source of the image and provide
      an alternative description of its image to the ones who can't see or interpret the image visual information. Hence
      we are going to use at least two attributes in the "img" tag element:</p>

    <img src="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/mochi-961ee5.gif"
      alt="pumping pale smiling emoji">

    <h3> &lt; img
      src = "address"
      alt = "description"
      &gt;
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>&lt;img&gt;</b>, the image container itself. A self-closing tag. </li>
      <li> <b>src="address"</b>, attribute which points the relative or absolute path address of the media.</li>
      <li> <b> alt="description"</b>, attribute which specify the image description in natural language.</li>
      <li> width = "number", "percentage %", "pixels px", "auto" </li>
      <li> height = "number", "percentage%", "pixelspx", "auto" </li>
      <li> max-width: 120% </li>

    </ul>

    <p> In addition to the more common "png" and "jpg" web image file extensions. "svg" (Scalable Vector Graphics) and
      "gif" (Graphic Interchange Format) are also quite recurrent and main formats when building or surfing pages on
      internet. </p>
